### Hello! Olá! 👋😀

👨‍🎓 I'm Gustavo Monteiro. I´m currently finishing my Electronics Engineering major´s degree at the University of Brasilia.

👔I was an engineering intern at a multinational network and telecommunications equipment company called Huawei for 2 years. I also did an internship in the area of ​​control and automation at the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Natural Resources (IBAMA).  I was part of a ​​software engineering scientific initiation project at the university, also worked as a volunteer in scientific events and was part of an aerial microvehicle development competition team as leader in Electronics, which led me to participate in an international competition in Spain, in 2019. I am also part of a research study group in ​​motion analysis using systems based on neural networks.

💻I have experience with projects in Python, data management language like SQL, data organization and visualization tools like Excel and PowerBI and currently studying tools like Tableau and R Studio, as well as R language. I've had contact with and also study programming languages ​​like C, Python, JavaScript and I develop some personal projects with front-end languages ​​like HTML, CSS and ReactJs. I have experience with numerical analysis software such as MATLAB and SciLab. I am an advanced English speaker, listener and writer, and also have some basic knowledge in Spanish. 

🏁I'm looking for opportunities to start a career in the area of ​​data analysis, Machine Learning and AI.

👉My portfolio can be found righ here at: https://github.com/gustavomontoli.

🕺I am also a dancer and love working out or going for a run at the park.

🎭I love anything related to culture and arts.

🍟I am a big fan of going out to eat with my friends or family.

🌎Travelling and discovering new places is one of my biggest passions.
